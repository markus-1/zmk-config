# zmk-config

Keymap for Corne Choc Pro BT. Mostly generated by the great [Keymap Editor](https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/)
from [Nick Coutsos](https://nickcoutsos.github.io/).

Uses [joelspadin/zmk-locales](https://github.com/joelspadin/zmk-locales), directly included `keys_de.h` as of
[Help a fåål · nickcoutsos/keymap-editor](https://github.com/nickcoutsos/keymap-editor/discussions/203)

Based on my [ZSA Voyager layout](https://configure.zsa.io/voyager/layouts/ageno/).

Notes:

- Function layer: Keep right GUI, CTRL and ALT free in order to use them with
  F-keys (ALT-F4).
